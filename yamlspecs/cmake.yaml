    CMake is a powerful software build system.
    It is an open-source cross-platform family of tools designed to
    build and test and package software. CMake is used to control
    the software compilation process using simple platform and
    compiler independent configuration files, and generate native
    makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler
    environment of your choice.

    configure: export CXXFLAGS='-Wl,-rpath=/lib64'; ./bootstrap --prefix={{root}}
